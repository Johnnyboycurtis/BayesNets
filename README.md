# BayesNets


`BayesNets` contains various implementations of the Naive Bayes through the perspective of Naive Bayes as a special version of a Bayesian Network.

## Algorithms

1. Classic Naive Bayes

2. Selective Naive Bayes algorithm

3. Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (treenb: discrete data and kdetree: continuous data)

4. Hierarchical Naive Bayes (in development)


## Dependencies

1. Numpy

2. Scipy

3. Pandas

4. Itertools

5. Matplotlib

6. Networkx


## Reference:

See [TAN](http://ai.stanford.edu/~moises/tutorial/sld164.htm) for an example of a Tree Augmented Naive Bayes.
